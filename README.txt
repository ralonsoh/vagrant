Vagrant templates and ansible scripts
=====================================

This project is a set of Vagrant templates to quickly deploy virtual machines
using different images (e.g.: RHEL9, Ubuntu 24.04).

It also provides some ansible scripts, executed from the Vagrant templates,
to update the OS or deploy OpenStack.
